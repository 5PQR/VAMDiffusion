## **VAM Diffusion**

VAMDiffusion is a VAM plugin that connects to locally running AUTOMATIC1111 stable-diffusion-ui. If stable-diffusion-ui has the API enabled, VAMDiffusion will connect to it and will send VAM screenshots to it for post-processing.

I DON'T DO REQUESTS FOR THIS! Please don't ask for features for this! I don't have time to work on it. License is MIT, others can edit it and build on top of it.


This works as a bridge for this Stable Diffusion tool: [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and for VAM (a NSFW sandbox game that I don't exactly recommend!). You'll need to know how to use both of them before attempting to use this plugin.
